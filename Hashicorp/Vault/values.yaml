  # Vault is able to collect and publish various runtime metrics.
  # Enabling this feature requires setting adding `telemetry{}` stanza to
  # the Vault configuration. There are a few examples included in the `config` sections above.
  #
  # For more information see:
  # https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/configuration/telemetry
  # https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/internals/telemetry
  serverTelemetry:
    # Enable support for the Prometheus Operator. Currently, this chart does not support
    # authenticating to Vault's metrics endpoint, so the following `telemetry{}` must be included
    # in the `listener "tcp"{}` stanza
    #  telemetry {
    #    unauthenticated_metrics_access = "true"
    #  }
    #
    # See the `standalone.config` for a more complete example of this.
    #
    # In addition, a top level `telemetry{}` stanza must also be included in the Vault configuration:
    #
    # example:
    #  telemetry {
    #    prometheus_retention_time = "30s"
    #    disable_hostname = true
    #  }
