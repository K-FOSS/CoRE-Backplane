    # ATTENTION:

    # When activating a daemon for the first time, a config file, even if it is

    # the daemon will not be started by /etc/init.d/frr. The permissions should
    # be u=rw,g=r,o=.
    # When using "vtysh" such a config file is also needed. It should be owned by
    # group "frrvty" and set to ug=rw,o= though. Check /etc/pam.d/frr, too.
    #
    # The watchfrr, zebra and staticd daemons are always started.

    # To make watchfrr create/join the specified netns, use the following option:

    # This only has an effect in /etc/frr/<somename>/daemons, and you need to
    # start FRR with "/usr/lib/frr/frrinit.sh start <somename>".

    # for debugging purposes, you can specify a "wrap" command to start instead
    # of starting the daemon directly, e.g. to use valgrind on ospfd:
    #   ospfd_wrap="/usr/bin/valgrind"
    # or you can use "all_wrap" for all daemons, e.g. to use perf record:
    #   all_wrap="/usr/bin/perf record --call-graph -"
    # the normal daemon command is added to this at the end.
